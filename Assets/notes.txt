L = plane width and height
n = number of penetrable objects (disks)
ρ = mean density = n/L^2 (lambda, intensity)
a = object area
η = ρa = filling factor = probability that a percolating cluster exists
φ = 1 − e^−η = total fraction of the plane covered by the objects
representative = cluster parent

R_L(η) = wrapping probability functions 
R^e_L(η) = the probability of any kind of wrapping cluster. 
R^h_L(η) = the probability of a cluster that wraps horizontally.
R^1_L(η) = the probability of a cluster that wraps horizontally, but not vertically
R^b_L(η) = the probability of a cluster that wraps both horizontally and vertically

horizontal and vertical wrapping probabilities are equal

disks are thrown at random in the L square (Poisson point process)

take a look at grid bin AddDisk, gotta fiddle with union find now

they do both splitting and compression?


sum down all to smallest n => P_L(a, n) is non zero
sum up all to highest n => P_L(a, n) is 1


for each simulation calculate ρ, then calculate η = ρa 

THEN SUM THESE BOYS UP IN (3)

(5) is essentially saying what critical factor η_L gives R_L = 1

Problem now is no periodic boundaries, when summing path 
cut part of the disk at the edge should be on the opposite side of the plane

i think we need to get the weights & cdf both non cumulative to a file
multiply cumulative sums (to n considered) by exp and thats R for a given n

once i get w's i need to divide each by cumulative sum of W multiplied by exp
