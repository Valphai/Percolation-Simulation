L = plane width and height
n = number of penetrable objects (disks)
ρ = mean density = n/L^2 (lambda, intensity)
a = object area
η = ρa = filling factor = probability that a percolating cluster exists
φ = 1 − e^−η = total fraction of the plane covered by the objects


disks are thrown at random in the L square (Poisson point process)

take a look at grid bin AddDisk, gotta fiddle with union find now
